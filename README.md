# MOBILE-BANK-AT-HAND
This is a platform where users can deposit, withdraw, and transfer money from their banks to other banks in the comfort of their homes through their phones.
The main objective of our model is to ensure that our partner BANK(s) keep its place in the market and stop losing its clients to easily avoidable situations like inaccessibility, poor customer service, and lack of trained staff.

AWS SERVICES USED FOR THE PROJECT
1. Amazon Cognito: Cognito will provide user authentication and authorization services, allowing us to securely manage user identities and sign-up/sign-in processes.
2. AWS Amplify: Amplify is a development platform that simplifies building mobile and web applications. It provides libraries, UI components, and backend services integration, including
authentication and data storage.
3. AWS EC2: With EC2, we create an instance and this instance is like a virtual machine where we can host our backend and will be used as a local server. To push our code to the
instance, we use the command git clone to clone the code from GitHub to the virtual machine
4. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM): IAM allows us to manage access to AWS services and resources. We used IAM to define fine-grained access policies and control
who can access and manage customer data within the banking platform.
5. Amazon Cloud Watch: Cloud Watch provides monitoring and logging services that can help track and analyze system and application logs for security purposes. We will use Cloud
Watch to monitor and detect any unusual activities or potential security breaches within the banking platform. We know that securing customer bank information involves a holistic
approach that goes beyond just using specific AWS services. We also considered implementing secure coding practices, conducting regular security audits, and following industry-standard
encryption and data protection guidelines to ensure the highest level of security for our banking
platform.
6. Amazon S3: Amazon S3 will provide scalable object storage for storing documents, images, and other files associated with customer accounts or banking transactions.
7. MONGO DB FOR AWS: Used for the back end which enables users to register and login
into their dashboard.
